a small python program to solve the beetle on the cube program from codevita.
A beetle is on the surface of a 10 x 10 x 10 cube. He is a fan of the cartesian cordinate system and can pinpoint itself on the surface of the cube using 3D cordinates. 
There are sweeets on the surface of the cube at various random locations. the goal is to find the shortest distance to each point via the surface.
